## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the Apache mod_proxy and mod_headers interaction vulnerability (CVE-2007-3730) where attackers could obtain internal IP addresses of systems behind a reverse proxy. This vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 1.3.39 and earlier, 2.0.61 and earlier, and 2.2.4 and earlier, and occurs due to improper interaction between the mod_proxy and mod_headers modules. When exploited, attackers can potentially view internal IP addresses of backend servers, leading to information disclosure and network topology mapping.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how mod_proxy and mod_headers interact when processing certain requests through a reverse proxy setup. Under specific configurations, the modules fail to properly sanitize or obscure internal network information in HTTP headers when forwarding requests to backend servers or returning responses to clients. This allows external attackers to obtain sensitive information about the internal network architecture, including private IP addresses of backend systems that should not be exposed to the outside world. This information could be leveraged for further targeted attacks against the internal infrastructure.
