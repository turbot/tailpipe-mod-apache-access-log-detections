## Overview

Detect when a web server showed signs of connection pool exhaustion based on concurrent connections. Web servers typically maintain connection pools with maximum limits on concurrent connections. As these pools approach capacity, the server may start to reject new connections, leading to degraded performance and potential service outages. This detection identifies periods of high connection volume or abnormal rejection rates that may indicate impending resource exhaustion.

The detection identifies connection pool risks by:
- Analyzing connection volumes over 1-minute intervals
- Identifying periods with high concurrent connection counts (exceeding 100 connections)
- Monitoring for elevated rejection rates (HTTP 503 Service Unavailable errors)
- Flagging conditions that may precede complete connection pool exhaustion

Connection pool exhaustion risks may indicate:
- Insufficient capacity planning for traffic levels
- Denial of service attempts (intentional or unintentional)
- Connection leaks in application code
- Misconfigured connection timeouts
- Load balancing issues
- Database connection pool problems
- Third-party service dependencies affecting connection handling

Early detection of these conditions allows for proactive scaling, tuning of connection parameters, or mitigation of potential denial of service activities before complete service failure occurs.
