## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the Apache mod_headers vulnerability (CVE-2015-4138) where malicious requests could bypass security restrictions through crafted headers. This vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.2.x through 2.2.29 and 2.4.x through 2.4.12, and occurs due to improper handling of header merging in the mod_headers module. When exploited, attackers can bypass security headers or inject malicious headers, potentially leading to cross-site scripting, information disclosure, or security control bypass.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how mod_headers processes and merges HTTP headers with the same name. The module's merging behavior could be manipulated through specially crafted requests containing carriage returns, newlines, or other control characters to inject new headers or modify existing ones. This could allow attackers to bypass security measures implemented through HTTP headers, such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, or X-XSS-Protection, potentially enabling cross-site scripting or clickjacking attacks.
