## Overview

Detect when a web server experienced unusual spikes in traffic volume compared to historical patterns. While traffic fluctuations are normal, sudden significant increases in request volume that deviate from established patterns can indicate various issues including viral content, misconfigured services, denial of service attacks, or other abnormal conditions. This detection compares current traffic levels to historical averages to identify anomalous patterns.

The detection identifies traffic spikes by:
- Analyzing request volume over 5-minute intervals
- Comparing current traffic volume to a rolling historical average
- Identifying periods where traffic exceeds historical patterns by a significant threshold (100% increase)
- Filtering out normal fluctuations by requiring a minimum baseline of historical data

Unusual traffic spikes may indicate:
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Content that has "gone viral" unexpectedly
- Misconfigured applications causing excessive requests
- Broken client applications making repeated requests
- Scanning or enumeration activities

Early detection of traffic anomalies allows organizations to investigate the cause and mitigate potential issues before they impact service availability or security.
