## Overview

Detect when a web server experienced unusual spikes in traffic volume compared to historical patterns. While traffic fluctuations are normal, sudden significant increases in request volume that deviate from established patterns can indicate various issues including viral content, misconfigured services, denial of service attacks, or other abnormal conditions. This detection compares current traffic levels to historical averages to identify anomalous patterns.
