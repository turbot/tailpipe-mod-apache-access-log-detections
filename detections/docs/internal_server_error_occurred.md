## Overview

Detect when a web server returned HTTP 500 Internal Server Error responses. A 500 Internal Server Error is a generic error message indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request. These errors typically indicate server-side problems such as application crashes, unhandled exceptions, misconfiguration, or resource constraints. Monitoring for 500 errors is critical for maintaining application reliability and identifying potential security issues.

The detection focuses on identifying HTTP 500 status codes in web server logs, which may indicate:
- Application code errors or bugs
- Server configuration issues
- Resource constraints (memory, CPU, connections)
- Database connectivity problems
- Potential exploitation attempts triggering application failures

A high rate of 500 errors can indicate service disruption, application instability, or possibly a security incident. Addressing these errors promptly is essential for maintaining service quality and preventing potential security vulnerabilities from being exploited.
