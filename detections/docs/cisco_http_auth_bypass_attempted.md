# Cisco HTTP Authentication Bypass Attempted (CVE-2003-1038)

## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the Cisco IOS HTTP Server vulnerability (CVE-2003-1038) where authentication could be bypassed through crafted URLs. This vulnerability affects various versions of Cisco IOS and occurs due to insufficient validation of URL parameters in the HTTP server component, allowing attackers to bypass authentication checks. When exploited, attackers can gain unauthorized access to the device's configuration interface, potentially leading to device compromise, unauthorized configuration changes, and exposure of sensitive information.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how the Cisco IOS HTTP Server processes certain URL patterns and authentication checks. By crafting specific URLs with encoded characters, path traversal sequences, or manipulated authentication parameters, attackers can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain access to restricted administrative interfaces. This could allow unauthorized configuration changes, device reboots, service disruption, and potential network compromise.
