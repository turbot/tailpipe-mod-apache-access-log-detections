## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the Cisco IOS vulnerability (CVE-2008-2049) where SNMP community strings could be obtained through TFTP configuration files. This vulnerability affects certain versions of Cisco IOS and occurs due to improper access controls on TFTP configuration files, allowing unauthorized users to retrieve SNMP community strings and potentially gain administrative access to network devices.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how Cisco IOS handles TFTP access to configuration files containing SNMP community strings. When exploited, attackers can obtain these strings through TFTP, which could then be used to gain unauthorized SNMP access to the affected devices, potentially leading to device compromise and network security breaches.
