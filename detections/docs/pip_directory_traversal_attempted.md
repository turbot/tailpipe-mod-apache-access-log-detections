## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the Python pip directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2019-20916). This vulnerability affects pip versions before 19.2 and occurs due to insufficient validation of filenames in the Content-Disposition header when downloading packages.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how pip handles the Content-Disposition header in HTTP responses when downloading packages. The `_download_http_url` function in `_internal/download.py` failed to properly sanitize filenames containing directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`). An attacker can exploit this by hosting a malicious package repository that serves Content-Disposition headers with directory traversal sequences in the filename, potentially allowing them to write files to arbitrary locations on the victim's filesystem, such as overwriting SSH authorized_keys files to gain unauthorized access.
