## Overview

Detect when known penetration testing or vulnerability scanning tools are used against the web server. This detection focuses on identifying distinct user-agent strings associated with security testing tools, automated scanners, and common attack frameworks. Many security tools leave distinctive fingerprints in their user-agent strings that can be identified through pattern matching.

This detection identifies a comprehensive range of security tools through their user-agent signatures, including specialized SQL injection tools (sqlmap, sqlninja, havij), vulnerability scanners (nikto, nessus, acunetix), web application scanning tools (dirbuster, gobuster, dotdotpwn, w3af), web proxies (burpsuite, OWASP ZAP), network mapping tools (nmap, masscan), fuzzing tools (Wfuzz), general exploitation frameworks (metasploit), password cracking tools (hydra), and generic scripting tools that are frequently used in automated attacks (wget, curl, python-requests, python-urllib). Empty or null user-agent values are also flagged as they often indicate deliberate attempts to hide the client identity.

These tools are primarily used for reconnaissance activities and automated vulnerability discovery before targeted attacks. Their detection provides an early warning of potential security testing or malicious activity targeting the web server. Organizations should monitor for these patterns, particularly on public-facing assets, administrative interfaces, and applications that handle sensitive data or provide access to critical systems. While some of these tools may be used for legitimate security testing, their presence in production environments without explicit authorization typically indicates unauthorized scanning or potential attack preparations.
