## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the LollMS Local File Inclusion vulnerability (CVE-2024-4315). This vulnerability affects LollMS version 9.5 and occurs due to insufficient path sanitization in the `sanitize_path_from_endpoint` function, which fails to properly handle Windows-style paths (backward slash `\`).

The vulnerability specifically relates to how LollMS handles path sanitization on Windows systems. By using backslashes in URL paths, attackers can bypass the sanitization mechanisms and perform directory traversal attacks. This can be exploited through various routes, including the `/personalities` and `/del_preset` endpoints, potentially allowing attackers to read or delete any file on the Windows filesystem, compromising system availability and security.
