## Overview

Detect when a web server was targeted by SQL injection attempts. SQL injection is a code injection technique that exploits vulnerabilities in applications that process SQL queries, allowing attackers to manipulate database queries to access, modify, or delete data without proper authorization. These attacks can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data breaches, and potentially complete compromise of affected databases and systems.
