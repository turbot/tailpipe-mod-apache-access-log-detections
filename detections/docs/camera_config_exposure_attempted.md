## Overview

Detect when a web server processed requests that may expose camera configuration data. This detection focuses on identifying potential configuration data exposure vulnerabilities, particularly the Cisco Linksys WVC54GC wireless video camera vulnerability (CVE-2008-4390) where configuration data, including passwords, was transmitted in cleartext in response to Setup Wizard remote-management commands. When configuration data is transmitted without encryption, attackers can intercept sensitive information by sniffing network traffic, potentially leading to unauthorized camera access and compromise of the surveillance system.
