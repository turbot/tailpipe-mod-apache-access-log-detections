## Overview

Detect when a web server received requests from unauthorized IP ranges or geographic locations. Many organizations implement network segmentation and access control based on IP address ranges to enforce the principle of least privilege and reduce the attack surface. Connections from unexpected IP addresses, particularly those outside of known corporate networks or from unexpected geographic regions, may indicate unauthorized access attempts, potential breaches, or misconfigured access controls.

The detection identifies access attempts from IP addresses outside of expected private network ranges:
- Access from non-RFC1918 private network addresses (outside of 10.x.x.x, 172.16-31.x.x, 192.168.x.x)
- Access from non-localhost addresses (outside of 127.x.x.x)
- Connections from potentially unauthorized external networks

This detection can help identify security policy violations, geofencing compliance issues, or potentially malicious activities originating from unexpected sources.
