## Overview

Detect when a web server was targeted by brute force authentication attempts. Brute force attacks are a trial-and-error method used to obtain information such as user credentials or personal identification numbers. In a brute force attack, automated software is used to generate a large number of consecutive guesses as to the value of the desired data. These attacks target authentication mechanisms and can lead to unauthorized access to accounts, sensitive data exposure, and further system compromise.
