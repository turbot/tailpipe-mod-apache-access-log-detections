## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the Apache mod_proxy_uwsgi buffer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2021-37555) where specially crafted requests could trigger buffer overflow conditions. This vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.48 and earlier, and occurs due to improper bounds checking in the mod_proxy_uwsgi module when processing certain uWSGI protocol data. When exploited, attackers can potentially cause denial of service conditions, server crashes, or even achieve remote code execution in certain configurations.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how mod_proxy_uwsgi processes uWSGI protocol data when proxying requests to backend uWSGI servers. The module improperly validates the size of incoming packets, which can lead to heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities. By sending carefully crafted requests with specially formatted uWSGI packet sizes, attackers can trigger memory corruption, potentially leading to server instability or arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is particularly concerning for servers that use mod_proxy_uwsgi to proxy requests to Python-based web applications like Django or Flask.
