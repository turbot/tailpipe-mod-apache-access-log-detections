# GeoServer SQL Injection Attempted (CVE-2023-25157)

## Overview
This detection identifies potential attempts to exploit CVE-2023-25157, a SQL injection vulnerability in GeoServer affecting versions up to 2.21.4 and 2.22.2. The vulnerability exists in how GeoServer handles OGC Filter expressions and Common Query Language (CQL) in Web Feature Service (WFS), Web Map Service (WMS), and Web Coverage Service (WCS) protocols.

## Risk Analysis

### Potential Impact
This vulnerability has a CVSS 3.1 score of 9.8 (CRITICAL), indicating the potential for:
- Unauthorized access to sensitive geospatial data
- Database compromise
- Remote code execution (RCE) in some configurations
- Data destruction or manipulation
- Privilege escalation within the application

### Attack Vectors
- Exploitation of specific CQL functions:
  - `strEndsWith`
  - `strStartsWith`
  - `PropertyIsLike`
- Misuse of `FeatureId` in PostGIS DataStore
- Custom crafted WFS, WMS, or WCS requests containing malicious SQL code
- No authentication required for exploitation on publicly accessible GeoServer instances

## Alert Analysis

### Investigation
When this detection is triggered, examine:
1. The request URI for explicit evidence of SQL injection attempts
2. Surrounding requests from the same IP address for reconnaissance activity
3. GeoServer access logs for anomalous patterns
4. Check if your GeoServer version is vulnerable (pre 2.21.4/2.22.2)
5. Verify if the PostGIS DataStore's "encode functions" and "preparedStatements" settings match the recommended configuration

### Potential False Positives
- Legitimate GeoServer queries using standard CQL syntax
- Non-malicious requests containing SQL-like syntax for geospatial operations
- Web application scanners performing security assessments

## Response

### Immediate Actions
1. Block the source IP address if malicious intent is confirmed
2. Upgrade GeoServer to version 2.21.4+ or 2.22.2+ immediately
3. If unable to upgrade, apply mitigation:
   - Disable PostGIS Datastore "encode functions" setting
   - Enable PostGIS DataStore "preparedStatements" setting
4. Analyze database logs for evidence of successful exploitation

### Mitigation and Prevention
1. Keep GeoServer updated to the latest stable release
2. Implement input validation for all CQL queries
3. Use application firewalls to detect and block SQL injection patterns
4. Consider network segmentation to restrict direct access to GeoServer instances
5. Implement authentication and authorization controls to limit access
