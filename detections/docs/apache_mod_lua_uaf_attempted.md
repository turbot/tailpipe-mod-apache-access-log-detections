## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the Apache mod_lua vulnerability (CVE-2022-29964) where specially crafted requests could trigger use-after-free conditions. This vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.52 and earlier, and occurs due to improper memory management in the mod_lua module when processing certain Lua handler requests. When exploited, attackers can potentially cause server crashes, denial of service conditions, or even achieve remote code execution in some configurations.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how mod_lua manages memory when handling Lua scripts. Under certain conditions, the module may access previously freed memory, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities. By sending carefully crafted requests to endpoints using Lua scripts, attackers can trigger this memory corruption, potentially leading to server instability or arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability is particularly concerning for servers that use mod_lua for web application functionality.
