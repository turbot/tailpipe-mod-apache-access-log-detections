## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the WebKit integer overflow vulnerability (CVE-2021-30663). This vulnerability affects iOS versions before 14.5.1 and occurs in WebKit's handling of web content, where an integer overflow condition can lead to memory corruption. When successfully exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution by having a user visit a maliciously crafted website.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how WebKit processes certain web content elements, where improper validation of numeric values can lead to integer overflow conditions. These conditions can be exploited to corrupt memory and potentially achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the WebKit process.
