## Overview

Detect attempts to exploit the Apache HTTP Server mod_proxy vulnerability (CVE-2022-24045) where malicious requests could lead to request smuggling and remote code execution. This vulnerability affects Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.52 and earlier, occurring due to improper validation of requests in the mod_proxy module. When exploited, attackers can craft special requests that bypass security controls and potentially achieve remote code execution through request smuggling techniques.

The vulnerability specifically relates to how mod_proxy handles certain malformed requests containing line breaks, control characters, or HTTP header injection attempts. By sending carefully crafted requests to proxy-related endpoints, attackers can potentially smuggle requests past security controls or inject malicious commands. This could lead to unauthorized access, remote code execution, or complete system compromise.
