## Overview

Detect when a web server processed requests that potentially violate data privacy requirements. Organizations are increasingly subject to strict data privacy regulations and standards such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate the protection of various types of sensitive data. This detection focuses on identifying API endpoints and form submissions that may be handling sensitive data, helping organizations maintain compliance and protect user privacy.
