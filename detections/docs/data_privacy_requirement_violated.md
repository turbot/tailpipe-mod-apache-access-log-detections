## Overview

Detect when a web server processed requests that potentially violate data privacy requirements. Organizations are increasingly subject to strict data privacy regulations and standards such as GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and PCI DSS, which mandate the protection of various types of sensitive data. This detection focuses on identifying API endpoints and form submissions that may be handling sensitive data, helping organizations maintain compliance and protect user privacy.

The detection identifies suspicious patterns that may indicate data privacy violations:
- API endpoints or form submissions containing sensitive data patterns (SSN, email, password, credit card, etc.)
- Endpoints with high concentrations of sensitive data handling
- Unusual patterns in how sensitive data is processed
- Endpoints accessed from multiple unique IP addresses while handling sensitive information

Violations of data privacy requirements can lead to regulatory fines, legal liability, reputational damage, and erosion of customer trust. This detection helps organizations identify and mitigate potential data privacy issues proactively.
